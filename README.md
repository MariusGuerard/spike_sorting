# Pipeline for Spike sorting algorithms

Most of the work is done in the script file (helper_function.py, feature_extraction.py, visualization.py) and the main.py uses these different functions to cluster signal amplitude into the different spikes that initiated it.  

The spike_sorting.ipynb notebook is the interactive version of the main.py
